<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->
This a very basic awesomewm configuration for arch. 

I dont really care about rice, so this config is just the stock awesomewm config with custom keybinds, default applications and custom startup applications.

The repo also contains the config files for some og the dependencies of the awesome config such as kitty, picom, rofi etc.

I also included a installation script that lets the user choose between a minimal, default and full configuration. The minimal configuration only contains the packages required for awesome to launch, such as xorg and awesome-git. The default configuration also contains the packages i refrence in the awesome config. This includes packages such as startup application (picom, feh) and applications connected to a keybind (vscode, nemo, kitty, firefox)

The installation script also prompts the user if he wants to use some custom cursors included in the project, and if the user wants to disable mouse acceleration.
